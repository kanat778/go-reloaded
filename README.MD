# GO-RELOADED

## Objectives

This program represents a simple **text completion / editing / auto-correction tool** written in Go.

The tool will receive as arguments the name of a file containing a text that needs some modifications (**input**) and the name of the file the modified text should be placed in (**output**).

---

## Supported Modifications

* Every instance of `(hex)` should replace the word before with the **decimal version** of the word (in this case the word will always be a hexadecimal number).
    - Ex: `"1E (hex) files were added"` -> `"30 files were added"`

* Every instance of `(bin)` should replace the word before with the **decimal version** of the word (in this case the word will always be a binary number).
    - Ex: `"It has been 10 (bin) years"` -> `"It has been 2 years"`

* Every instance of `(up)` converts the previous word into **uppercase**.
    - Ex: `"Ready, set, go (up) !"` -> `"Ready, set, GO!"`

* Every instance of `(low)` converts the previous word into **lowercase**.
    - Ex: `"I should stop SHOUTING (low)"` -> `"I should stop shouting"`

* Every instance of `(cap)` capitalizes the previous word.
    - Ex: `"Welcome to the Brooklyn bridge (cap)"` -> `"Welcome to the Brooklyn Bridge"`

    - For `(low)`, `(up)`, `(cap)` if a number appears next to it, like so: `(low, <number>)` it turns the previously specified number of words in lowercase, uppercase or capitalized accordingly.
        - Ex: `"This is so exciting (up, 2)"` -> `"This is SO EXCITING"`

* Every instance of the punctuations `.`, `,`, `!`, `?`, `:` and `;` should be close to the **previous word** and separated from the **next one** by a space.
    - Ex: `"I was sitting over there ,and then BAMM !!"` -> `"I was sitting over there, and then BAMM!!"`

    - Except if there are groups of punctuation like: `...` or `!?`.
        - Ex: `"I was thinking ... You were right"` -> `"I was thinking... You were right"`

* The punctuation mark `'` will always be found with another instance of it and they should be placed to the right and left of the word(s) inside them, without spaces.
    - Ex: `"I am exactly how they describe me: ' awesome '"` -> `"I am exactly how they describe me: 'awesome'"`
    - Ex: `"There is no greater agony than    '    bearing a untold story inside you."` -> `"There is no greater agony than' bearing a untold story inside you."`

* Every instance of `a` should be turned into `an` if the next word begins with a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) or an `h`.
    - Ex: `"There it was. A amazing rock!"` -> `"There it was. An amazing rock!"`
